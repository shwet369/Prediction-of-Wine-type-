# Prediction-of-Wine-type-Using machine learning 
Here we will predict the quality of wine on the basis of given features. We use the wine quality dataset available on Internet for free. This dataset has the fundamental features which are responsible for affecting the quality of the wine. By the use of several Machine learning models, we will predict the quality of the wine.

- Importing libraries and Dataset:
- Pandas is a useful library in data handling.
- Numpy library used for working with arrays.
- Seaborn/Matplotlib are used for data visualisation purpose.
- Sklearn – This module contains multiple libraries having pre-implemented functions to perform tasks from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation.
- XGBoost – This contains the eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm which is one of the algorithms which helps us to achieve high accuracy on predictions.
Food and Beverage Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning
Overview:
This guide aims to help you get started with deep learning for predicting the quality of food and beverages using machine learning libraries like Keras. We will use the wine quality data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository as an example.

## Data Set Description:
The wine quality data set includes 12 variables, a few of which are detailed below:

### Prediction of Wine type using Deep Learning
Wine Quality Data Set Overview
- Data Set Description:

- Fixed Acidity: Total acidity divided into volatile and nonvolatile acids (g/dm³).
- Volatile Acidity: Indicates wine turning into vinegar (g/dm³).
- Citric Acid: One of the fixed acids in wine (g/dm³).
- Residual Sugar: Sugar remaining after fermentation (g/dm³).
- Chlorides: Contributor to wine saltiness (g/dm³).
- Free Sulfur Dioxide: Part of sulfur dioxide added to wine (g/dm³).
- Total Sulfur Dioxide: Sum of bound and free sulfur dioxide (g/dm³).

### Data Loading and Preprocessing:

- Import necessary libraries.
- Load the data set.
- Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, normalize features).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Understand the distribution of data.
- Visualize relationships between variables.
### Model Building:

- Define the neural network architecture using Keras.
- Compile the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer.
###n Model Training:

- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train the model on the training data.
### Model Evaluation:

- Evaluate the model performance on the testing set.
- Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
### Prediction:

- Make predictions on new data.
- Analyze the results and refine the model if necessary.

The aim is to use this data to get started with deep learning libraries such as Keras and to understand the basics of neural networks.
