# Prediction-of-Wine-type-Using machine learning 
Here we will predict the quality of wine on the basis of given features. We use the wine quality dataset available on Internet for free. This dataset has the fundamental features which are responsible for affecting the quality of the wine. By the use of several Machine learning models, we will predict the quality of the wine.

- Importing libraries and Dataset:
- Pandas is a useful library in data handling.
- Numpy library used for working with arrays.
- Seaborn/Matplotlib are used for data visualisation purpose.
- Sklearn – This module contains multiple libraries having pre-implemented functions to perform tasks from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation.
- XGBoost – This contains the eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm which is one of the algorithms which helps us to achieve high accuracy on predictions.

### Prediction of Wine type using Deep Learning
Wine Quality Data Set Overview
- Data Set Description:

- Fixed Acidity: Total acidity divided into volatile and nonvolatile acids (g/dm³).
- Volatile Acidity: Indicates wine turning into vinegar (g/dm³).
- Citric Acid: One of the fixed acids in wine (g/dm³).
- Residual Sugar: Sugar remaining after fermentation (g/dm³).
- Chlorides: Contributor to wine saltiness (g/dm³).
- Free Sulfur Dioxide: Part of sulfur dioxide added to wine (g/dm³).
- Total Sulfur Dioxide: Sum of bound and free sulfur dioxide (g/dm³).
The aim is to use this data to get started with deep learning libraries such as Keras and to understand the basics of neural networks.
